A simple Snake game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The snake moves on a game board and must eat the fruits (represented as red squares) to grow. The game ends if the snake crashes into the walls or itself. You can restart the game by clicking the "Restart?" button after losing.

Use the arrow keys (⬆️, ⬇️, ⬅️, ➡️) to move the snake.
